This means that $i$ reached the end of $S_1$ and $j$ reached the beginning of $S_2$, somehow passing over the correct pair. Suppose that $k$ was passed over by $i$ before $l$ was passed over by $j$. Therefore at that point when $i=k$, the sum was $S_1[k] + S_2[j]$, which we know satisfies $S_1[k] + S_2[j] > S_1[k] + S_2[l] = x$ since $j>l$ and $S_2$ is sorted. Since the sum is greater than $x$, $j$ would be decremented until the sum was equal to $x$ or less than $x$.

We could maintain 2 pointers, one moving left to right and one right to left, and then try every different position for the third. But we will likely get values that are both below and above $T$, and therefore there is no way to know which pointer we should change.\n",

    "In this case we will have to do a more systematic and less clever search. Specifically, we can look at all the $k-1$-tuples, and for each perform a binary search to see if the element necessary for the correct sum is present.\n",

    "How many such $k-1$-tuples are there? If we allow numbers to appear more than once, then $n^{k-1}$.

However, if we do not, then the only allowable tuples are $(0,1), (0,2), (1,2)$; there are $n \\choose {k-1}$, which is clearly less than $n^{k-1}$. Note that permutations are equivalent: $(1,0)$ is not included because $(0,1)$ is already present. These represent indices of $S$ to sum, and it doesn't matter what order we sum them in.\n",

The `dup` flag determines whether numbers in $S$ can be used repeatedly, and specifies whether the `construct_subsets` or `construct_tuples` function is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is the running time of the `sum_to_T` function?** We break it up into its parts: **(1)** sorting $S$, **(2)** constructing the set of $k-1$-tuples, and **(3)** a binary search for each tuple.\n",

    "Second, the $k-1$-tuples are constructed, of which there are at most $n^{k-1}$; substantially less if duplicates are not allowed, which is the default behavior. This is $O(k\\cdot n^{k-1})$, since the inner-loops in both the construction functions each add a single element to a single tuple in the collection. Therefore the number of times this occurs is limited by the total number of indices in the collection of tuples. Viewed differently, a set of tuples is like a matrix, with each tuple a separate row. Then there are $n^{k-1}$ rows and $k$ columns, for a total of $k\\cdot n^{k-1}$ elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that the $O(k\\cdot n^{k-1})$ bound for tuple construction already violates our goal of an $O(n^{k-1} \\log n)$ algorithm. However, if we don't allow values in $S$ to be used twice, which seems like the more natural usage case, the number of tuples becomes drastically smaller. Specifically we have:\n",
    "$$ {n \\choose {k}} = \\frac{n!}{k! \\, (n-k)!} \\stackrel{(1)}{\\leq} \\frac{n^k}{k!} \\leq n^k$$\n",

    "where (1) follows from the fact that only the first $k$ terms of $n!$ are retained; the rest are divided out by the $(n-k)!$ term in the denominator. Since successive factors in $n!$ grow smaller, making them all $n$ can only increase the value of the product.\n",
    "\n",
    "These equalities become strict when you note that $k$ cannot equal 1. Otherwise the problem reduces to searching for a number $x$ in an unsorted list, which cannot be done in $O(n^{k-1}\\log n) = O(n^0\\log n) = O(\\log n)$ time. Therefore plugging $k=k-1$ into the inequalities, the number of tuples is $O\\left(\\frac{n^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}\\right)$ and construction is $O\\left(\\frac{k}{(k-1)!} \\cdot n^{k-1}\\right)$. Plugging in $k=2$ into the first factor, $\\frac{2}{1!} = 2$. Plugging in $k=3$, $\\frac{3}{2!} = 1.5$. And plugging in $k=4$, $\\frac{4}{3!} = \\frac{4}{6} = 0.67$. These are clearly getting smaller, with a maximum of $2$. Therefore construction is $O(n^{k-1})$, making it not the bottleneck in an $O(n^{k-1} \\log n)$ algorithm.\n",

Then perform a binary search looking for this value. Finally, if a value is found, scan over the tuple to make sure that it wasn't already included in the sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary search is $O(\\log n)$, but there are also $2$ scans over the $k-1$-tuple. This is done potentially for all $O\\left(\\frac{n^{k-1}}{(k-1)!}\\right)$ $k-1$-tuples. As shown above, multiplying this factor by $k$ reduces it to $O(n^{k-1})$. So including the binary search, the portion of the algorithm is $O(n^{k-1} \\log n)$.\n",

Since $k \\geq 2$ (since as noted above the $k=1$ case is equivalent to asking for a log-time search in an unsorted list, which is impossible), this reduces to $O(n^{k-1} \\log n)$ as desired. This is only true in the case where numbers in $S$ cannot be used more than once towards the sum, which I imagine is the more usual usage case. The function implemented below can also allow repeats, but will be slower, I believe by a factor of $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most difficult part of this problem was actually constructing the set of $k$-tuples. If $k$ is known, it can easily be implemented as a series of $k$ nested loops. But here $k$ is arbitrary. The case where duplicates are allowed (`construct_tuples`) was tedious to get the details right. The case of unique indices (`construct_subsets`) cleverly involved recursion, so there I was hostage to inspiration.\n",
    "\n",
    "After having solved this problem, I had this thought, which I won't further explore now... but why not do this: sort $S$ and construct all $k-2$ tuples, similar to before. Then use the algorithm from 4.6 and 4.8 to determine if there is a *pair* of numbers in $S$ that sum to the needed amount. Sure, this last part is $O(n)$ for each tuple, rather than $O(\\log n)$, but the tuples are now of size $k-2$ rather than $k-1$. Why wouldn't this lead to an $O(n^{k-2}\\cdot n) = O(n^{k-1})$ solution?\n",

    "NOTE: In the implementation of the partition function given in the book, `i` is incremented from `l` until the condition `i<h`; so `i` only reaches `h-1`. This loss of $1$ comparison for each partition would essentially count the number of nodes in the tree of recursion calls. The reason why `i` need not reach `h` is because `s[h]` IS the partition element in the book's implementation and need not be compared with itself. In the solutions below we will assume that the counter `i` does reach `h` for 3 reasons: (1) simplicity; (2) even in the book's implementation, the condition can be trivially changed to `i<h+1` with no change in functionality, since `p = h`, and so the inner loop condition `(s[i] < s[p])` will fail; and (3) in this question we assume that the partition function somehow selects the median value. This may or may not located at `h` and so `h` would need to be checked anyway.\n",

Therefore the location of the smallest element is equal to $k$. So how can we find this smallest value? We use the fact that the elements are already sorted, modulo the circular permutation. We need to convert this into a test we can perform to determine if we need to look in the left or right subrange. Looking at the example again, we see that all the numbers in the array are greater than or equal to the first number, $35$, *until* the numbers reset, at which point they are all less than $35$. This observation probides our condition: we test if the median of the subrange is less than or greater than the first value; if less, then we look in the left subrange, if greater, we look in the right.
