Two important things to note are that 1) we are asked to show the correctness of a recursive algorithm, and so almost surely we will use mathematical induction; and 2) we have 3 variables: $y$, $z$, and $c$. Must we increment all of them in our induction proof? I guess it depends on whether we need their induction hypotheses to show algebraic equality. Note that in the recursive function call, the $y$ argument is multiplied by $c$, and so is larger. Therefore the induction hypothesis won't help for $y$. The $z$ argument gets smaller, so here an induction hypothesis would be helpful. What about $c$?

As `j` is incremented, at some point $A[j]$ will refer to the subset's largest element. At that point, $A[j]$ will be greater than $A[j+1]$, and so these will be swapped. Then when `j` is incremented, $A[j]$ is now still equal to that largest value. In this manner the largest element will be propogated to the end of the subset. If the largest element is not unique, then these elements will be propogated right until they meet an equal element. In this case, they won't be swapped, but since they are equal, the value of $A[j]$ still won't change when `j` is incremented and so will still point to the largest value in the subset. And so the end result is the same, the last element of the subset (including position `i`) is now the (possibly not unique) largest element of the subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another fact is: *after the `i`th iteration, the element in position `i` won't move.* The next iteration only considers elements $1$ though $i-2$ because `i` will be incremented, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "A consequence of the 2 results above is: *after the `i`th iteration, the element in position `i` is smaller than or equal to all the elements to its right.* To prove this, let's suppose otherwise. Suppose that after the `i`th iteration, $A[i] > A[i+k]$ for some $k>0$. But after the (earlier) `i+k` iteration, $A[i+k]$ was larger than all elements to its left, and the element hasn't changed since. Furthermore, $A[i]$ must have been among those elements to the left of position `i+k`, for if it was to the right, an iteration would have already occurred referring to that position, freezing it in that spot, even though it is now located in positon `i`. Therefore, $A[i+k] > A[i]$, which constradicts our assumption, and the result is proved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting the above 3 results together, after the `i`th iteration, the element in position `i` is larger than or equal to all the elements to its left, is small than or equal to all the elements to its right, and won't move on later iterations. *So it is permanently in its correct sorted position.* Therefore after all $n$ iterations of `i`, every element is in its correct sorted position, and the list is sorted."

The solution was to just *solve* for the equivalent of the \"$nth\\_term$\". The reason why this worked is because in the earlier induction problems, the *point* of using the inductive hypothesis was to turn a summation (which is algebraically hard to deal with) into a nice compact expression. In this problem, the function *f* was algebraically very simple. The inductive hypothesis was used to assure us of some property, in this case divisibility by 3."
