    "TAKING LOGS AND EXPONENTS DOES NOT PRESERVE DOMINANCE RELATIONSHIPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, $n^3$ dominates $n^2$, but $\\log n^3 = 3\\log n$ does NOT dominate $\\log n^2 = 2 \\log n$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example, $\\log(n^3) = O(\\log(n^2))$ but $n^3 \\neq O(n^2)$, since $e^{c\\cdot \\log(n^2)} = e^{ \\log(n^{2c})} = n^{2c} \\neq c n^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The FUNDAMENTAL reason for this is that $\\log cf(n) \\neq c\\log f(n)$. Same for $\\exp(cf(n))$. So a given $c$ used to show a given dominance relation can't be reused after taking the logarithm or exponent, since the $c$ is no longer a multiplying factor in front of the new function. The transformed inequality WILL HOLD, but it is not with the function you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "A result of this idea (that logs and exps don't preserve dominance relationships) was stated on page 51: \"Logarithms cut any function down to size\", specifically, the log of ANY polynomial is $O(\\lg n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, logs and exps WILL preserve inequalities, but likely will not preserve dominance relations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not true of taking the square: $(c\\cdot f(n))^2 = c^2 \\cdot f^2(n)$. So now $c^2$ is your new \"$c$\".\n",
    "\n",
    "By the way, this is a property called [homogeneity](http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Homogeneous_function), where $f(cx) = c^kf(x)$ for some $k$."

    "First we address the case where $n$ is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem imposes 2 constraints: 1) that the probability of each number in $S$ appearing in $S'$ be the same, and 2) that we select exactly $k$ numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "My first thought is to iterate over the numbers in $S$, and for each number, choose to include it in $S'$ with probability $k\\,/\\,n$. One can imagine having a weighted coin where you can set the probability of heads arbitrarily, and flipping it with $p = k \\, / \\, n$ for each element of $S$. The problem with this procedure is that there is a non-zero probability of selecting 0 elements, all $n$ of the elements, or any number in between. Actually, the probability of $m$ numbers being included in $S'$ will form a binomial distribution. Yes, the mode and mean (expected value) will be $k$, but we are required to select exactly $k$, not just in the average case.\n",
    "\n",
    "My second though is to generate the set of all $n$ choose $k$ subsets of size $k$ containing numbers from $1$ through $n$ and pick one subset at random. But let's say that such an algorithm is not available to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enforce that we select exactly $k$ numbers, we can modify the probability of selection as we go. For example, if we have already included $k$ numbers, we set $\\text{P(selection)} = 0$ for all remaining elements of $S$. Actually, we are *conditioning* the selection probabilities on the outcomes of previous selections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take an example. Let $S = \\{1, 2, 3\\}$ and let $k=1$. First we consider selecting number $1$. This element needs to have a selection probability of $1\\,/\\,3$, and since there are no previous decisions to condition on, we must set $P(1) = 1 \\, / \\, 3$. Now consider number 2. We must condition its selection probability on whether or not number 1 was included. Written out, $P(2) = P(2|1)\\cdot P(1) + P(2|\\bar{1})\\cdot P(\\bar{1})$, where $\\bar{1}$ indicates that number 1 was not selected. If number 1 was selected, then $P(2|1)= 0$, since we are only allowed to select 1 number. Therefore we have $P(2) = P(2|\\bar{1})\\cdot P(\\bar{1})$, meaning the only way for the number 2 to be selected is for number 1 to be NOT selected, and then for number 2 to be selected. This probability must come out to $1\\, / \\, 3$. Plugging in $P(\\bar{1}) = 1 - P(1) = 2 \\, / \\, 3$, we have $P(2) = P(2|\\bar{1})\\cdot 2 \\, / 3 = 1 \\,/ \\, 3$. Therefore $P(2|\\bar{1}) = 1 \\, / \\, 2$. Now consider number 3. If either numbers 1 or 2 have already been included, then $P(3) = 0$, otherwise $P(3) = 1$. Does this come out to an overall selection probability of $1 \\, / \\, 3$? The only way number 3 can be selected is for both numbers 1 and 2 to be NOT selected. The probability of this happening is $P(3) = P(\\bar{1}) \\cdot P(\\bar{2}|\\bar{1})$ $= (1 - P(1)) \\cdot (1 - P(2|\\bar{1}))$ $= (2 \\, / 3) \\cdot (1 \\, / \\, 2)$ $= 1 \\, / \\, 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conditioning selection probabilities in this way, we have enforced the 2 desired constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take one more example before we try to generalize to arbitrary $n$ and $k$. Let $S = \\{ 1, 2, 3\\}$ and $k = 2$. Every element must have a selection probability of $P = 2 \\, / \\, 3$. To enforce this on number 1, we set $P(1) = 2 \\, / \\, 3$. Now consider number 2. The general form of its selection probability is $P(2) = P(2|1) \\cdot P(1) + P(2|\\bar{1}) \\cdot P(\\bar{1})$. Plugging in the probabilities for number 1, we have $P(2) = P(2|1) \\cdot 2 \\, / \\, 3 + P(2|\\bar{1}) \\cdot 1 \\, / \\, 3$. If number 1 was NOT selected, since there are only 2 numbers remaining and $k = 2$, we must select number 2. Therefore $P(2|\\bar{1}) = 1$, leaving us with $P(2) = P(2|1) \\cdot 2 \\, / \\, 3 + 1 \\, / \\, 3$. Since this must equal $2 \\, / \\, 3$, we must have $P(2|1) = 1 \\, /\\,2$. Now consider number 3. If both numbers 1 and 2 were selected, then $P(3) = 0$. Otherwise, $P(3) = 1$. Does this produce an overall selection probability of $P(3) = 2 \\, / \\, 3$? The only way for 3 to be NOT selected is for both numbers 1 and 2 to be selected. This will occur with probability $P(1) \\cdot P(2|1) = 2 \\, / \\, 3 \\cdot 1 \\, / \\, 2 = 1 \\, / \\, 3$. Therefore $P(\\bar{3}) = 1 \\, / \\, 3$ and $P(3) = 1 - 1 \\, / \\, 3 = 2 \\, / \\, 3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We successfully enforced both constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generalize this to arbitrary $n$ and $k$, let's look at the selection of number 2 in the previous example. We will write $k'$ for the number of unassignmed \"slots\" remaining in $S'$, and $n'$ for the number of numbers in $S$ which have yet to be considered. If number 1 had already been selected, then we have $k' = 1$ and $n' = 2$; we are choosing whether number 2 or 3 should fill the remaining vacancy in $S'$. We calculated in this case that $P(2|1) = 1 \\, /\\,2$. In the event that number 1 was NOT selected, we have $k'=2$ and $n'= 2$. So both numbers 2 and 3 must be selected to fill the 2 vacancies in $S'$. Therefore $P(2|\\bar{1}) = 1$. In both these cases, $P(2) = k' \\, / \\, n'$. Indeed, this equation holds for numbers 1 and 3 as well. Regarding number 1, $k' = k$ and $n' = n$, and so we set $P(1) = k \\, / \\, n$. Regarding number 3, since this number was last, we had $n' = 1$ and $k'$ equal to either $0$ or $1$, resulting in selection probabilities of $0 \\, / \\, 1$ or $1 \\, / \\, 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This suggests that as we iterate over $S$, we keep track of the remaining number of vacancies in $S'$ as $k'$, and the remaining number of elements from $S$ to be considered as $n$, and for each number in $S$, include it in $S'$ with probability $k' / n'$. The two examples above suggests that this procedure works in general.\n",

    "**Second, I found another way of thinking about the problem.** The problem asks us to iterate over the numbers and select whether each number is to be included in $S'$. A *probabilistically equivalent* way of thinking about the problem is to imagine that the numbers which are included in $S'$ *are already set*, and we sequentially \"*reveal*\" whether each one is indeed included. Since we have no prior information, number 1 is included with probability $k\\,/\\,n$. Once we \"*reveal*\" whether number 1 is included, we update our information about the other $n-1$ numbers, namely that they each have an equal chance of being found amongst the $k$ or $k-1$ remaining vacancies in $S'$. This formulation makes it apparent why the probability that each number is included is $k' \\, / \\, n'$. The math above shows that these two formulations are indeed the same.\n",

Therefore, the number of marbles is $\\lceil 7 \\, / \\, 2\\rceil = 4$. When the lowest floor is identified that breaks the marbles, if this was discovered with a reused marble, then there is a chance that the marble only broke because it was weakened from a previous drop.
