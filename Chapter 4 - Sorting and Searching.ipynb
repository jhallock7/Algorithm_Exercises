    "**Case:** $k$ is known.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example given in the problem statement where $k=2$, the largest element is $42$ and is located at position $1$. It should be at position $n-1$, but instead is located at position $(n-1 + k) \\bmod n = (6 - 1 + 2) \\bmod 6 = 7 \\bmod 6 = 1$. Generally, when circularly shifting numbers, they move from position $i$ to position $(i + k) \\bmod n$. To find the largest element, plug in $i = n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this case, the largest element is $A[(n - 1 + k) \\bmod n]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case:** $k$ unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to determine $k$, after which it is an instant lookup to find the largest value. So how can we find $k$ in $O(\\lg n)$ time? $\\lg n$ suggests a binary search. Looking at the $k=2$ example $\\{35, 42, 5, 15, 27, 29\\}$, we note that the value $5$ should be in position $0$ but instead is in position $2$. Therefore the location of the smallest element is equal to $k$. So how can we find this smallest value? We use the fact that the elements are already sorted, modulo the circular permutation. We need to convert this into a test we can perform to determine if we need to look in the left or right subrange. Looking at the example again, we see that all the numbers in the array are greater than or equal to the first number, $35$, *until* the numbers reset, at which point they are all less than $35$. This observation probides our condition: we test if the median of the subrange is less than or greater than the first value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution given below fails when the numbers are not distinct. Suppose we are given a set of $n$ numbers where $n-1$ of them are all the same. In this case, when we test the middle element, if it is the same as the first element, we have no idea if the differing element is to the left or to the right. Furthermore, we don't know if it will be less than or greater than all the other values, so we can't just ignore it. We have to find it. But there is no longer any property amongst the numbers that can expedite our search.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, I don't see how an $O(\\lg n)$ algorithm is possible in the case where the numbers are not distinct."
