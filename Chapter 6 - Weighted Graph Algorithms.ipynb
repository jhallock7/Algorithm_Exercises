    "\n",
    "**2) Equal-weight edges are swapped.** Here it depends on the implementation. For example, a triangle with 3 weight-1 edges will engender an MST with one of the edges missing. Prim's algorithm seems to be deterministic once a starting point is selected, but Kruskal's algorithm, as given in the textbook, uses quicksort to sort the edges based on weight. The random nature of quicksort can give rise to different orderings among the 3 edges since they are of equal weight. Therefore the 2 edges selected to be in the MST may differ on repeated runs of Kruskal's algorithm, only one of which can match Prim's. If a stable sort like merge sort was used instead, so that equal-weight edges were placed in order based on their array index, this may lead to a deterministic result that may always match Prim's.\n",

Both add to 6, but clearly they are different edges with different weights. I do not believe this situation can occur because 1) both algorithms are greedy, and so would choose to include the edge of weight 2 as soon as possible. 2) I have not been able to construct an example where the selection of an edge meaningfully forces the algorithms to make different decisions later. And 3) choosing the edge with weight 3 doesn't pay off until after the other edge of weight 3 is included; therefore at this moment, the two algorithms may have included the same nodes but have different total weights. If we were to delete the non-tree nodes at this point, only one of the algorithms could be correct. You may object that the incorrect algorithm was making its decision based on the presence of the rest of the nodes, and that deleting them \"tricked\" the algorithm. But this isn't true because both algorithms are greedy, and are not capable of that sort of planning ahead."

    "No. Suppose we have a triangle with edge weights 2, 3, and 4. The unique MST will consist of the edges of weights 2 and 3, leaving out the edge of weight 4. On the MST, traveling between the two vertices included in the weight-4 edge would require passing through the root, and the path would have weight $2 + 3 = 5$. But on the original graph the shortest path is the edge between them, which has weight $4$. Therefore even in the case where the MST is unique, finding the MST still does not mean you have found the shortest path between any two vertices."

    "In the book, this problem is only described in terms of unweighted graphs as an application of the network flow problem, which does use weighted graphs. The problem is solved by connecting a source to all L vertices and a sink to all R vertices. All edges have weight 1, both original and added. Then find the maximum flow from source to sink.\n",

    "One idea I had was to use breadth-first search to compute the tree. Then count the number of clusters in each row. One edge can be included from each cluster since they all connect to the same parent, so the number of edges you can include from each level is equal to the number of clusters. But you can only include edges from every other level. So just add up the number of clusters on the even numbered levels and the odd numbered levels, and the greater one is the one you choose to include in the matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "This idea doesn't work though in general, maybe only if the tree is fully dense. If a level includes a dead-end edge, then you can include both the dead end edge and edges in the next lower level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an example of a graph, with the BFS tree computed starting from vertex 1. The vertices are numbered in the order that they were added to the tree. The brackets indicate the number of clusters in each level, and the circled edges are the ones that perhaps form a maximum matching. Note that the number of clusters are $1-1-1-1-2-2-2$, and summing up alternating levels equals $6$ and $4$, but the circled matching contains $8$ edges, showing that the maximum matching can exceed these values.\n",

    "Is there a way to do this conceptually on the original graph? Perhaps targetting dead-ends first? The original graph is still a tree, but isn't organized into a top down shape with a root."
