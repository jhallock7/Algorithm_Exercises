    "I originally tried to solve this problem by enumerating permutations of the index and pruning them appropriately. (Skip this paragaph if you want.) For example, $S = \\{1, 1, 2, 2\\}$ contains 4 numbers, so permutations of the numbers 1 through 4 will correspond to permutations of $S$. The only problem is that some of these index permutations will correspond to identical set permutations, due to the repeated elements. For example, both index permutations $\\{1, 3, 2, 4\\}$ and $\\{1, 4, 2, 3 \\}$ produce the set permutation $\\{1, 2, 1, 2\\}$. However, we may note that only one of these satisfies the condition that indices corresponding to identical set elements are in sorted order. Specifically, both indices $3$ and $4$ correspond to the number $2$ in the set $S$. So if we require that such numbers be in sorted order, then only one of these index permutations is valid, $\\{1, 3, 2, 4\\}$. However, I was unable to encode this without using a \"stack\" data structure. Specifically, for set-values already included, a second auxilliary data structure would be needed to record what index was used most recently that corresponds to this value. (The first data structure is a bit vector for included indices.) For example, when adding index $3$ to the partial solution $\\{1, 4, 2\\}$, we would need check that $S[3] = 2$ was already included using index $4$, and since $3 < 4$ this would break our requirement that indices that correspond to equal set values be in sorted order. The problem is how to implement the `unmake_move` function when there are more than 2 identical elements. For example, if there are 5 3's in the set $S$, then our second auxiliary data structure would essentially have to record the order in which these 5 different indices were added. This could be done with a stack. However, I was able to find a more elementary and direct solution to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we can compute a histogram-like structure that tells us how many more times we can include a given value. For example, say you have 3 unique numbers, like $S = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 7, 7]$. We can turn this into two arrays $H = [2, 3, 2]$ and $I = [1, 2, 7]$, where the first tells you how many of each number you have, and the second is what the number is. Together, these form a sort of histogram, with $I$ the x values and $H$ the y values.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each iteration in the backtracking algorithm, the potential candidates for the next position in our solution vector $A$ are any index from $0$ to $m-1$ such that $H[i] \\neq 0$, where $m$ is the number of unique values in $S$. When a number $i$ is added to $A$, we decrement $H[i]$ by one to indicate that we have one less of that number available for future positions. To undo this, we increment $H[i]$ by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, although this solution is conceptually different from how the permutation problem is treated, it may in fact be a generalization. The permutation problem uses a bit vector to indicate what indices from $1$ to $n$ have already been included. This is analogous to our $H$ array, only in the permutation problem we know that each number appears exactly once, and so True/False values can be used instead of 1's and 0's. Also, there is no need for an $I$ array in the permutation case because the value and the index are equal."

    "This problem is similar to enumerating all the perumutations of a set of $n$ numbers, where $n$ is the length of the string, but for 3 complications. Strings are multisets, meaning they can have repeated elements. Permuting equal letters doesn't change a word, so unless we accound for this, the same anagram will appear multiple times. The second complication is that anagrams are free to include differing amounts of words separated by spaces, as long as they contain the same set of letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third complication is the requirement that the resulting strings be dictionary words.\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct the anagrams, we will convert the original string into a histogam-like structure that will track how many more times we may use each letter. \"Space\" will also be an option unless the previously added character was also a \"space\". We will use a backtracking algorithm to recursively extend partial string vectors $A$ one character at a time, using the histogram to track what characters remain available for insertion.\n",
    "\n",
    "To enforce the requirement that the words be found in the dictionary, each time we add a \"space\" we will check if the word is contained in a list of dictionary words, found in `'Other/Dictionary_words.txt'`. The `is_word()` function makes use of the `bisect` module to implement a binary search. When we have found a potential solution, we use the `is_word()` function again to check if the last word in the solution is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program implemented below works, but takes about a minute to run on the string 'steven skien', and is too slow to run on 'steven skiena'.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important area where the program can be improved is the `is_word()` function. Currently a binary search is performed on a list of valid words that originally was stored at `/usr/share/dict/words` on my computer. However, this list **does not contain plurals** even though it contains 235886 words. I found a list of dictionary words online that contained 354986 words, but many of them did not seem to be valid words, like \"wl\", and many other two-letter combinations. For example, the word \"pillow\" produces 33 or 2498 different anagrams depending on which of these two dictionaries is used. I opted for the smaller one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of manually performing a binary search on a list of dictionary words, I could have used a specialized spell checker library that would probably provide better and faster results, but I am not sure if I can \"import\" modules in an Ipython Notebook hosted on GitHub."
