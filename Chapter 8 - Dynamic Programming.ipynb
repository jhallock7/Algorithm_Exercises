We now propose the following algorithm for converting the given non-greedy solution into the greedy solution: we keep placing the smallest not-included program $P_{smallest}^{(U)}$ into the solution set if there is room, and if there isn't, we swap it with the largest program currently in the solution $P_{largest}^{(S)}$.

    "Consider the problem of storing $n$ books on shelves in a library. The order of the books is fixed by the cataloging system and so cannot be rearranged. Therefore, we can speak of a book $b_i$, where $1 \\leq i \\leq n$, that has a thickness $t_i$ and height $h_i$. The length of each bookshelf at this library is $L$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose all the books have the same height $h$ (i.e. , $h = h_i = h_j$ for all $i$, $j$) and the shelves are all separated by a distance of greater than $h$, so any book fits on any shelf. The greedy algorithm would fill the first shelf with as many books as we can until we get the smallest $i$ such that $b_i$ does not fit, and then repeat with subsequent shelves. Show that the greedy algorithm always finds the optimal shelf placement, and analyze its time complexity."

    "First note that the fact that you cannot reorder the books is crucial for the correctness of the greedy algorithm. For example, suppose 7 books have thicknesses $\\{20, 20, 20, 50, 20, 20, 50\\}$ and shelves have length $100$. If we had to keep them in order, the greedy algorithm would place them on shelves as $\\text{Shelf 1} = \\{20, 20, 20 | -40\\}$, $\\text{Shelf 2} = \\{50, 20, 20 | -10\\}$, and $\\text{Shelf 3} =  \\{50 | -50\\}$, using 3 shelves with 100 units of free space. If they could be reordered, the optimal packing would be $\\text{Shelf 1} = \\{50, 50 |0\\}$ and $\\text{Shelf 2} = \\{20, 20, 20, 20, 20 |  0\\}$, using 2 shelves and leaving no free space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, note that Skiena does not define what he means by the \"optimal shelf placement\". This could mean \"using the smallest number of shelves\" or \"leaving the smallest amount of space free\". However, these two definitions are equivalent; an arrangement of the same books on the same number of shelves will take up the same amount of space, and therefore will leave the same amount of space free. For two arrangements to leave different amounts of space free, they must use different amounts of shelves.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will prove the optimality of the greedy algorithm by contradition. Suppose that a given arrangement $P$ uses $n$ shelves, but the greedy algorithm would use more than $n$ shelves.\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, assume that there is no empty shelf space between books, meaning that on every shelf the books are pushed all the way to the left, and any free space occurs to their right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without loss of generality, we will speak of the books being placed in their positions in catalog order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the current arrangement $P$ is not greedy, there must have occured a time when a book was placed on the next shelf, even though there was still room for it on the current shelf. Therefore in the current arrangement, there must be a book $i$ at the beginning of a shelf that can be moved to the end of the previous shelf. Let us make that move. Doing so will reduce the amount of free space on the earlier shelf and will increase the amount of free space on the later shelf. If the moved book was the only book on its shelf, then we have just freed up a shelf. Any further moves will ignore that shelf. If we repeat this move at many times as possible, we will have produced the greedy arrangement. And because each move could only decrease the amount of shelves moved, and never can increase, we can be sure that the greedy solution contains the same number of shelves or less than the original, \"optimal\" arrangement. But this contradicts our assumption that the greedy solution was not optimal.\n",

From each of these sets of coins, we would only need to add a single coin of denomination $d$ to equal $n$ cents.
